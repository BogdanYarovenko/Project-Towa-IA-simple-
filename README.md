The advantage of AI is to minimize the risk of our towers being destroyed by those of our opponents. The AI ​​was made with the chosen action method. The method goes through all the squares on the game board and places a tower starting with the bottom right square, then adds more on the same square up to the height limit and moves to the previous column of the same line.

So, to create the AI, I therefore used the methods of the PlayerTowa class (like estDansPlateau, direction) are also useful and used for checks and calculations.
